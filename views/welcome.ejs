  <h2>Camellia Sinensis Plant:</h2>
  <p>All types of ‚Äútrue‚Äù tea actually originate from the same plant. The botanical name for the tea plant is <span>camellia sinensis</span>. This plant originated in southern China thousands of years ago, and has been cultivated and consumed for hundreds of years. Camellia sinensis has two main varietals: camellia sinensis var. sinensis, which grows primarily in China and other East Asian countries and has a milder, mellower character, and camellia sinensis var. assamica, which grows primarily in India and is generally heartier and more robust.</p>
